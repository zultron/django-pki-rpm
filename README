RPM packaging materials for django-pki

As it is, this depends on the zultron github repo:

https://github.com/zultron/django-pki

It probably depends on EPEL for el6, and two additional RPMs not found
there:

https://github.com/zultron/python-iterpipes-rpm

https://github.com/zultron/pygraphviz-rpm
